# Wizardz!
This is a game I made in about 6 hours after having a dream about it.

## Concept
The game is about spawning and growing your own energy balls, spawning wizards around them in exchange of energy,
while shooting the other player energy balls in order to destroy them.

## Explanation
Each player (red and blue) start with one energy ball each, separated by neutral energy balls to avoid shooting each other too soon.
- You can spawn new wizards around your own energy balls, or spawn new energy balls in empty places.
- You can also shoot energy to the other player energy balls, decreasing their energy.

## Controls
The game is played with the keyboard:
- Red player: WASD + Space
- Blue player: Arrows + Enter
