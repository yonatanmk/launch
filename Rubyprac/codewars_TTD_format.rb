# These are some of the methods available:
#   Test.expect(boolean, [optional] message)
#   Test.assert_equals(actual, expected, [optional] message)
#   Test.assert_not_equals(actual, expected, [optional] message)

describe "Solution" do
  it "should test for something" do
    Test.assert_equals("actual", "expected", "This is just an example of how you can write your own TDD tests")
  end
end
