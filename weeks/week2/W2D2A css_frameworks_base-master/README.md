# CSS Frameworks

The aim of frameworks in general is to provide a common structure so that developers donâ€™t have to redo it from scratch.

CSS frameworks:
- allow for quicker and easier styling
- provide a cohesive, semi-polished look right off the bat
- are super easy to install!
- help with mobile-friendly layouts

Note: The original version of this repo was created by cmkoller. I have developed this code base so that students and I can have a basic and completed version to work with.


Furbies are the LEAST of my worries? What could potentially be worse than the eventual Furby apocalypse? 

There are so many parts of your profile I love I don't know where to start. Awkward experiences, Nick Offerman, and Pixar-induced tears are a good place, though

Sorry for the late reply. I hate a some lessons to prepare and a sensory deprivation tank to crawl into? My life is exceptionally mundane, but I just really wanted to justify my tardiness with something potentially radical.

Haha the Truth is short form radio plays and they are AMAZING! A few have even brought a tear to my eye, and I was so certain that I had a heart of stone. I'm also addicted to the Adventure Zone at the moment. I'm not a Dungeons and Dragons guy, but the stuff these fellow put out is hilarious. Strangers is what I have been going to for the Moth-esque storytelling. Got any favorites?

Awkward Experiences: I'm learning all of the time because my life is perpetually awkward. Today none of my students were reacting to my presentation, so I just spoke in a high pitched voice for the remainder. No one was laughing, so I was stuck just sounding like Tinkerbell. And it was recorded.

Nick Offerman: Yes.

Pixar: To be fair, Wreck-It Ralph actually brought tears to mine eye ducts, so I guess I'm just a sucker for anything animated.
