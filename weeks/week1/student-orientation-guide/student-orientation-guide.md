# Taking Care of the Space and Each Other

## Deck 7 Guidelines

Thank you for helping us to keep Deck 7 a clean, welcoming environment for our instructors, students, hiring partners, guest speakers, alumni and other visitors. This is your home for the next ten weeks, and you have a lot of roommates. The guidelines set here are to ensure whoever may enter our space gets the impression our students are highly intelligent, hard-workers, who know how to be both professional and personable. Should we get a surprise visit from a prospective hiring partner, a clean, clutter-free space will help our case for employers to want to hire a Launcher – _we have the most capable students and they know how to be great employees!_

**DO NOT:**
- Open windows, or go out onto the fire escape for any other reason than an emergency. If you are found to be opening a window or on the fire escape, you will be removed from the program- zero tolerance
- Prop open any doors (especially external building doors)
- Smoke near building access points. Tenants are asked to not smoke near the entrance to the building and are suggested to stand closer to the corner of Downtown Crossing
- Eat or have open containers at the workstations
- Leave funky food in the fridge or spills on the counters
- Forget to return your access card at the end of the cohort


[Back to top](#)

#### Building Information

- **Restrooms:** Just as you would our suite space, please keep these tidy as we want to be sure any prospective hiring partners have clean bathrooms to visit as well.
  - If materials need to be replenished, please DM the Office Manager on Slack
- **Stairwell:** The stairwell is locked, so you are able to walk down from the 7th Floor to get outside, but can not take the stairs up. Do not prop open any exterior building doors (back staircase or front entrance)
- **Bicycles:** Bikes are not allowed on Deck Seven. An off site indoor bike room (approx. 1 block away) may be available to you. Please DM the Office Manager on Slack to talk about those options.

#### Cleaning Up the Workstations and Kitchenette

- **Work areas: No food or open liquid containers at the work desks!** Keep desks clean and check for trash on, around or near your area before you leave at the end of the day.
- **“Leave-behinds”:** Anything left around the space (on chairs, tables, couches, etc.) and on the dish rack will be placed in a “leave-behind” bin, located near the lockers. Items should be removed from this bin by Friday afternoon as anything left in it come Monday morning will be tossed/donated. Utilize the lockers! The “leave-behind” bin can be found on the bottom shelf of the gray storage rack.
- **Refrigerator:** Our space is funky, our fridge is not! Please mark items with your name and date. The fridge is cleared out every Friday via a rotating student schedule, and anything that is unmarked (or without a current date) or sprouting will be tossed. If it is your turn to clean out the fridge:
  1. Take out all unmarked items and put them on the counter
  2. Send out a message to the cohort to come identify or throw away their items before a certain time
  3. Clean up any spills in the fridge
  4. Throw away whatever is left out on the counter. All students will be on clean out duty once.
- **Toaster ovens/microwaves:** Please wipe down after use so they are clean for the next person.
- **Coffee maker:** We are a green organization so please bring a reusable cup/mug to Deck Seven (or use the blue one we’ve provided). We do have paper cups, but reserve those primarily for visitors’ use. Please don’t remove your cup from the machine until after the light shuts off to prevent spillage.
- **Counters and table:** Please wipe up any spills and throw away all trash. If you do not know how to wipe up spills, let a Launch staff member know and they will model it for you.
- **Sink and dish rack:** Do not leave dishes in the sink. Utilize the dish rack and then move your items to the lockers.  Items left in the sink will be tossed.

#### General Deck 7 Information

- **Internet:**  
  - **WiFi Network:** LaunchAcademy  
  - **Password:** MakeNoBugs!  
- **White boards:** If you do not want your work erased, please mark it clearly; otherwise the cleaning crew will erase it each evening.
- **Courtesy in the work areas:** Use headphones if you want to listen to music during individual exercises - no noisy video or music in the work area. Silence your phones (keep them on vibrate), and take calls away from the work area. No loud voices. No strong fragrances.
- **Greeting Visitors:** If you are nearest to a visitor when they enter Deck Seven, please welcome them, ask for their name (and introduce yourself), and walk them to a staff member. If a staff member is not readily available, please alert the Office Manager. Act as if Launch Academy is your company and a guest has just arrived.

#### Access Cards
Everyone will receive an access card to the suite. Our doorman, Noel, is present M-F 8-6, and occasionally on weekends. To enter the building after hours, you will need to swipe your card on the access scanner to the right of the door outside.

- **Building Hours:**  
	Monday-Friday: 	8:00am - 6:00pm  
	Weekends:	8:00am -  6:00pm	(access cards required)  

The back staircase leads to the street on the side of the building.  The doors to and from the back staircase should never be propped open. This is a major security breach and can result in removal from the program.
- **Visitors:** Occasionally you may wish to bring a visitor to the space, and to ensure the security of our learning space, the following rules apply:
  - Please refrain from allowing guests to visit while class is in session so as not to disturb your cohort.
  - All guests must sign in with the doorman, Noel, downstairs
  - You must notify Laura Kenney (Office Manager) of your guest prior to their arrival

# Graduation Requirements

Students entering Launch Academy have passed our rigorous screening process. We consider all Launch Academy Students to be talented individuals and have the potential to become great developers. However, there is no guarantee that everyone will keep up with the pace of the curriculum and the volume of work. Launch Academy has a clear grading rubric and requirements for graduation.

## Grading Rubric

Whether or not you are on track will be measured by two key performance areas: Your *Technical* and *Career* preparation.

In order to Graduate, you must:

- Achieve a total Technical score of *10* points or higher
- Achieve a total Career Preparation score of *10* points or higher

The points allocated to each grade are:
- Meets Expectations - 2 points
- Exceeds Expectations - 3 points
- Does Not Meet Expectations - 0 points
- Makeup - 1 point

A makeup point is for any assignment you received a *Does Not Meet Expectation* grade on but that you successfully completed afterwards. That makeup point will be based on re-working and making another submission or otherwise putting in extra effort to fill in the gaps of what you didn't understand.

### Technical Requirements

At Launch Academy, we use *System Checks* to measure your pacing through the curriculum. They are timed challenges, meant to assess your understanding of the material taught on a given week.

There are 6 System Checks included as a part of the on-site program. Attending and completing each System Check is mandatory, regardless of your present academic standing as outlined above. System Checks must be completed *without* the help of your fellow launchers - however, you are free to reference your own code, our lessons, or Internet resources.

### Grading and Code Review

When Code is submitted for review, the Experience Engineers at Launch Academy take a look at its structure and execution to give it one of three grades: *Meets Expectations*, *Does not Meet Expectations*, or *Exceeds Expectations*. These requirements are clearly specified for each lesson that will be graded.

Experience Engineers use three criteria to determine if a submission receives a *Meets Expectations* grade:

- Does the code meet the acceptance criteria of the assignment exactly?
- Does the code adhere to the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)?
- Does the test suite run and all tests pass (if provided, or if you've written your own)?

If the submission falls short of any of these, your submission will receive a *Does Not Meet Expectations* grade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

All graded assignments will include Acceptance Criteria which describe what we're expecting the code to do, and what you can do to get it there. In order to meet the acceptance criteria, the code must accomplish all the tasks described, given any restrictions described in the assignment.  In addition, we're looking to see that you're understanding the material, and using the skills we have taught you.

#### Adhering to the Style Guide

It is important that your code be readable by other programmers. Ruby has decided on a series of styles and guidelines that, when adhered to, help us all better understand each other's code.

Small digressions from the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) will not negatively effect your grade. However, certain fundamental style problems (like not properly indenting, or using capital letters in method definitions or variable names) will lower the overall grade.

#### Passing Test Suite

Some assignments will come with a test suite. They will come with instructions on how to execute them, so you can test your progress as you work through the problem. If the submitted code has a test suite, but that test suite does not pass, it will receive a *Does Not Meet Expectation* grade.

### Career Preparation Requirements

Please see the
[Career Services Grading Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sb6eHq4PYSAQjl3HTr5TjNqD2pjeCBWgCSjbhQvzZqk/edit?usp=sharing)
for more information.

## Measuring your Progress

As you progress through the On-Campus program, you'll have regular chances to meet with your mentor and discuss your progress through the curriculum. In Horizon, you can view your Progress Report by accessing it in the menu under your username.

If you receive a *Does not Meet Expectations* on a System Check, you and your mentor will meet to discuss the material and your understanding of it. This is a chance to make sure you understand the material, and to figure out a plan to get you back on track. Additional *Does not Meet Expectations* will incur additional conversations with your mentor and the Experience Director to discuss your pacing and mentorship needs.

# Career Services

Please see the
[Career Services Orientation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VQkDGuulwOfZ0TqsQk6vgggUXSZ9mLk-wBxUqAeQYc/edit?usp=sharing)
for more information. This document outlines the Career Services requirements for attending Career Kickoff, and what happens afterwards.

# Launcher Life

Launch Academy counts as **work experience** in your new coding career, to allow you to count this as work experience we expect you to, at a minimum, treat this as a 40 hour work-week in the physical space of Deck 7.  Below is the general schedule of your "work day".

## Daily Schedule

**Mornings**  
**9:00 AM** — Arrive at Deck 7  
**9:38 AM** — Meet in Mentor Groups to discuss pervious evening's readings & challenges  
**10:45 AM** — Facilitation (extended lecture on topics from night before)  
**11:00 AM** - Daily Challenge Released  
**11:45 AM** — Daily Quiz  
**12:00 PM** — Lunch  

**Afternoons**  
Free work time  
**1:00 - 3:00 PM** — Work on Daily Challenge / Scheduled Office Hours  
**3:00 PM** — Clinic(s), Evening exercise released  
**5:00 PM** — End of official work day  

That being said, the students who get the most out of Launch Academy have generally had similar work ethics and schedules, and below we have shared a guideline for what we feel is a good recipe for success.

This is a bootcamp, and the volume of material will sometimes feel overwhelming.  This feeling is not only totally normal, but also expected!  The important thing is not to fall behind, putting off new readings to finish previous assignments can quickly snowball into a recipe for disaster.  When in doubt, prioritize comprehension over completion.  And never forget: sleep is an essential part of learning!  If completing an evening assignment means that you will be a zombie the next day and not absorb anything, contemplate if it may be more worthwhile putting the computer down and coming in the next day with a fresh set of eyes.


## Suggested Schedule
**Mornings**  
**8:00 AM** — Finish any incomplete assignments from previous day / night, go over previous nights reading to check for comprehension.  
**9:38 AM - 12:00 PM** Same as Above  

**Afternoons**  
**1:00 - 4:00 PM** — Same as Above  
**4:00 - 5:00 PM** — Continue Daily Challenge  

**Where** the following happens is up to you, but we highly recommend staying at D7 as long as your schedule allows to use this space (and each other) as a resource.

**5:00 PM** - Start evening reading (don't worry if daily challenge is not complete)  
**6:30 PM** - Dinner  
**7:30 PM** - Begin Evening Challenge  
**9:30 PM** - Wrap up  
Have a minimum of 7 hours of sleep.

## Staff Availability

Staff at Launch Academy have a lot of varied responsibilities, so it's important that we all organize our time carefully.

When EEs are "off the floor" - i.e., in the EE lounge, they aren't available to answer technical questions. This space is off-limits to students.

For day-to-day technical questions, ask one of the two EEs who are on the floor every afternoon, or take advantage of time during office hours to clarify topics. See below for more about how to use office hours.

In reference to broader concerns than day-to-day technical questions, you should definitely feel comfortable getting in touch with your mentor - Slack is usually a great place to find them! They are here to support you.

[Back to top](#)

## Feedback

We value feedback here a lot! Our program has evolved program to program based on the feedback we receive from our students, alumni, and hiring partners. The feedback you provide is paramount to the future of our program. We will collect feedback throughout in the following ways but always feel free to also connect with the EE or business staff with ideas.

- Weekly Check-in: Each Monday we will send out a 1-2 question feedback form to get your thoughts/feelings on the previous week.
- Lessons: We are constantly revamping and updating our curriculum. Be sure to let us know your thoughts about individual articles, challenges or exercises in the form at the bottom of each page on Horizon.

## Attendance

Students must scan-in via their LaunchPass QR code, found on their user profile, upon entering Deck 7 each morning. It is very crucial to take full advantage of the time you have at Launch Academy and to try to be present every single day. That said, if you are sick and can't be productive at Deck 7, **get in touch with your mentor** on Slack and the two of you can work together to make sure you stay caught up.

While we don't recommend it, if you have a pre-existing obligation that you want to see if you can make work, talk to your mentor and they can help give you and idea about whether it's feasible to miss that time from the program.

[Back to top](#)

## Office Hours

You will have multiple appointments for 20-minute "office hours" throughout the cohort. Office Hours serve as a chance to sit down with an EE and take some time to work through a problem together, one-on-one. Take time to think about how you want to spend this time in advance. Some great uses of office hours include:

- Getting a code review on a project you've written
- Working together to refactor some code you're working on
- Getting extra help with a topic you feel weaker on
- Diving deeper into a more advanced topic you're excited about
- Bouncing ideas for a side project around
- Pair-programming on a tricky piece of code

Check the Office Hours spreadsheet for your scheduled meeting times. Please, put them into your calendar.

[Back to top](#)

## Breakable Toys

Your Breakable Toy is a project you will build over the course of your time here, and that is meant to showcase what you've learned at the end of the cohort. More details will be forthcoming about the ideal scope and focus of the project. Ideally, you'll be able to pick a great topic/goal/purpose, and make it something you're really passionate about! While the last two weeks of the cohort are purely dedicated to Breakable Toy work, start brainstorming early what sort of project you might be excited to build. There will be assignments and planning meetings starting week 6 to get you ready to go for week 9.

# Launch Tools

There are a number of different tools and resources you will have at your disposal during your time at Launch! Here is a walkthrough of the things you should be aware of and paying attention to:

## Calendar

You should have access to a Google Calendar called “Deck 7”. This will the home-base for information on lesson schedules, clinics, office hours, Launch events, tech community events. Visit here often to make sure you’re up-to-date with what’s going on!

[Back to top](#)

## Slack and the Staff Announcements Channel

On Slack, there is a channel called Staff Announcements. This is for **only** staff to post in, and this is where we will announce important day-to-day information such as the release of new challenges. Make sure that you pay attention to everything posted in that channel - you will get behind if you tune out!

[Back to top](#)

## Horizon

Horizon will in many ways be your home base for information at Launch. Luckily, you should already have some familiarity with Horizon from your Ignition challenge submissions!

### Horizon Dashboard

Your [Horizon Dashboard](https://learn.launchacademy.com/dashboard) serves as a home base for all the most important information you'll need on a day-to-day basis. This includes:
- A list of all **core, required assignments** and whether or not they've been completed and reviewed, and a link to all assignments (including non-core required)
- A list of all lesson supplements ie slides from facilitation, links to video recordings of facilitations / lectures, etc.
- A list of upcoming **calendar events**, spanning the next two days
- A feed of your questions on Horizon Questions.

### Horizon Questions

[Horizon Questions](https://learn.launchacademy.com/questions) will serve as your primary way of getting assistance from staff members. When stuck on a problem, make sure to search Horizon (via the topbar) to see if anyone else has asked a relevant question. [Guide to Asking Questions](https://learn.launchacademy.com/lessons/asking-questions-at-launch)

If you still can't solve your problem after about 15 minutes of being stuck, add a question on Horizon. We'll accept ​*all*​ questions, no matter how vague, and help you learn how to ask better question in order to grow your problem solving skills, which is an invaluable skill as a developer.

An EE will either provide a possible answer in the queue, comment requesting more info, or come over to discuss how to update your question and tackle a solution.

The Question Queue is a list of questions in line to get in-person help from an EE. When it's your turn, you and an EE will work together to solve the problem. Note, broader questions will take us longer to get to, but go ahead and ask them. Once solved, write out the answer on your Horizon question so that others can benefit in the future!

After a question has been successfully answered, don't forget to click "accept answer" to show the answer that fixed your problem.
