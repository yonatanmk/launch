### Introduction

[Learn Git Branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a great interactive learning tool that will guide you through working with git branches.

We recommend that you work through the "Introduction Sequence" and "Push & Pull" under the "Remote" tab. Working through all of the sections is not necessary.
