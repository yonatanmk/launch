Please submit 1-3 ideas for your Breakable Toy, with a brief paragraph description for each one. When describing your idea, please consider the following three questions:

- What is the very first feature you will start out with? (This means 1-2 models, and some simple functionality that you can deploy early.)
- Are there several models involved in your app, along with CRUD for each one? (There should be!)
- Do you have some ideas for "fancy" features you can incorporate into your app if you have time? (e.g., APIs, data visualization, cool JS or AJAX features?)
- Does my idea align with my personal hobbies or interests? If not, it might be tough staying personally invested in building out this idea.
- Can my idea be implemented as a Web Application written in the Rails web framework? If not, that's a problem. Your Breakable Toy is required to be a web application, written in the Rails framework, with Unit and Feature Tests.

If you are fairly certain about what you want to do for your Breakable Toy, you only should feel obligated to submit that one idea, although please do come up with others in case we think your original idea will not be feasible for some reason.

If you're not feeling very certain about what you want to do, please submit several ideas so we can talk through the different options with you.

If you're feeling very stuck, don't spend too much time worrying about coming up with the "perfect idea" - just write down a couple things, even if you think none of your ideas are any good, and we can help you build them up from there!

Please submit this by the end of Week 6.
