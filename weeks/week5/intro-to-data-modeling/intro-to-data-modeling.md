### Introduction

In this video lesson, we learn about data modeling. We take an idea about a neighborhood and some rules that govern the entities in the neighborhood and go from basics to a fully fleshed out model.


### Learning Goals

* Understand how to take basic ideas about entities and turn them into a data model.
* Understand some of the jargon associated with data modeling
* Illustrate a data model visually with its associations
