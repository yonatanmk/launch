### Introduction

Most applications require handling different types of information that are often related in one form or another. In this article we look at several of those types of relationships and how we can model them in a relational database.

### Learning Goals

* Identify different types of information within a database
* Extract information into separate tables to minimize redundant data
* Link tables together using **primary keys** (pk) and **foreign keys** (fk) to define a one-to-many relationship
* Understand how many-to-many relationships are implemented using join tables

### Structuring Information

Consider the following table of movies and the actors:

```no-highlight
Movie Title    | Year | Actor            | Character          | Genre
---------------+------+------------------+--------------------+------------
Aliens         | 1986 | Sigourney Weaver | Ellen Ripley       | Action
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Diane Keaton     | Annie Hall         | Comedy
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Woody Allen      | Alvy Singer        | Comedy
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Dennis Hopper    | Photo Journalist   | Drama
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Marlon Brando    | Colonel Kurtz      | Drama
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Robert Duvall    | Lt. Col. Kilgore   | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Al Pacino        | Michael Corleone   | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Diane Keaton     | Kay Adams          | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Marlon Brando    | Don Vito Corleone  | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Robert Duvall    | Tom Hagen          | Drama
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tim Allen        | Buzz Lightyear     | Animation
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tom Hanks        | Woody              | Animation
```

Here we include the name of the movie, the year it was released, a few actors and the characters they played, as well as the genre of the movie. This sampling of data could be a part of a much larger database, all stored in the same format.

Now consider a query to list all movies starring Diane Keaton. To answer this we can scan the table and pick out any rows where Diane Keaton appears in the actors column:

```no-highlight
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Diane Keaton     | Annie Hall         | Comedy
The Godfather  | 1972 | Diane Keaton     | Kay Adams          | Drama
```

The format of the table makes this query easy to answer. Each row corresponds to a separate movie starring Diane Keaton.

How about a query to list all of the genres. For this we can similarly scan the table and check the genre column, but on a first pass we end up with many duplicate entries:

```no-highlight
Action
Comedy
Comedy
Drama
Drama
Drama
Drama
Drama
Drama
Drama
Animation
Animation
```

We found four genres, but we ended up with twelve rows since each line has a genre (even if it's a duplicate). It's not that difficult to fix though: we can make a second pass and filter out any genres we've seen before:

```no-highlight
Action
Comedy
Drama
Animation
```

What if we wanted to list all movies that have [no actors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_%281964_film%29)? This query is a bit more perplexing. All of the movies in our sample have actors so we wouldn't find anything there, but how would we even represent this? We just want to store the title, year, and genre without any info for the actor or character. One strategy would be to leave these columns blank:

```no-highlight
Movie Title    | Year | Actor      | Character   | Genre
---------------+------+------------+-------------+--------------
Empire         | 1964 |            |             | Avante-garde
```

This works but the actor and character columns are irrelevant here. They are only added as placeholders to avoid breaking the format of the rest of the data. Think about how this would work if we wanted to count the number of actors in a movie?

Things become more challenging when we consider adding more information to our database. Where would be the best place to add a description for each movie? We could add another column to the table but if a movie has multiple rows (one per actor) then which row contains the description?

```no-highlight
Movie Title   | Year | Description           | Actor
--------------+------+-----------------------+---------------
The Godfather | 1972 | description goes here | Al Pacino
The Godfather | 1972 | and here...           | Diane Keaton
The Godfather | 1972 | and here...           | Marlon Brando
The Godfather | 1972 | and here too...       | Robert Duvall
```

How about reviews for movies? We could add another column for reviews, but we run into the same problem as before. Which row contains the review, or should we duplicate it among all rows for that particular movie? What if there are multiple reviews for a given movie? What if there are no reviews?

### Enter "Normalization"

A single table works well when we're dealing with a single type of information. If we had a list of tasks to complete, a single table with a task per row works great.

This structure starts to break down when we are dealing with multiple types of information. Trying to cram everything into a single table becomes cumbersome and results in lots of duplication. If we want to remain flexible in how we can query and maintain our database, it becomes useful to split the different types of information into separate tables.

This process of splitting our information into separate tables to minimize duplication is known as **normalization**. In addition to saving space, reducing duplication often means having a single row to represent any particular entity (e.g. every movie would have only one row that defines the existence of that movie and its attributes). This makes it simpler to identify where new information should be stored and how to structure our queries.

### How to Normalize Data and Construct Tables

To start, let's consider what types of information we're working with. We have a movie title and year, actors and the characters they portrayed, as well as the movie genre. Where do we draw the line between one table and another?

One strategy is to look for **duplicate values**. We might notice that our genre is repeated several times. Would it be beneficial to move this to a separate table?

To answer this question we have to think about what a genre is. Can a genre exist without the presence of a movie? It's possible if our database isn't exhaustive: it might not contain any documentaries in our table but that doesn't mean the genre doesn't exist. Having a separate genres table will allow us to add new genres before we have to add a movie containing them.

Let's look at our movies table:

```no-highlight
title          | year | actor            | character          | genre
---------------+------+------------------+--------------------+-----------
Aliens         | 1986 | Sigourney Weaver | Ellen Ripley       | Action
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Diane Keaton     | Annie Hall         | Comedy
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Woody Allen      | Alvy Singer        | Comedy
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Dennis Hopper    | Photo Journalist   | Drama
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Marlon Brando    | Colonel Kurtz      | Drama
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Robert Duvall    | Lt. Col. Kilgore   | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Al Pacino        | Michael Corleone   | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Diane Keaton     | Kay Adams          | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Marlon Brando    | Don Vito Corleone  | Drama
The Godfather  | 1972 | Robert Duvall    | Tom Hagen          | Drama
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tim Allen        | Buzz Lightyear     | Animation
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tom Hanks        | Woody              | Animation
```

If we wanted to separate genres into a new table, it might look something like:

```no-highlight
id | name
---+-----------
1  | Action
2  | Comedy
3  | Drama
4  | Animation
```

We extracted the name of each genre so that it only occupies a single row. This table is now the definitive location to find information on genres. We don't have any duplicate rows or redundant data here.

Notice how we also have an ID column. This column is known as the **primary key** of the table and enables us to identify a genre easily and unambiguously. The ID values aren't significant except that they are unique per row and are not reused. Primary keys do not necessarily need to be integers but they should always be able to unique identify a particular row.

One other benefit of having a definitive source for genres is that we might want to add additional information to the table at some point (e.g. providing a description). Since each genre exists as its own row, it becomes simple to add a new column without any duplication:

```no-highlight
id | name      | description
---+-----------+--------------------
1  | Action    | lots of explosions
2  | Comedy    | roflmaololol
3  | Drama     | lots of tears
4  | Animation | lots of CGI
```

### One-to-Many Relationships

After we extract genres into a separate table, what does this mean for the original movies table? How can we associate a particular genre back to a movie? We can create a relationship between the two tables.

Here we can replace our `genre` column with a reference to the new table we created:

```no-highlight
title          | year | actor            | character          | genre_id
---------------+------+------------------+--------------------+-----------
Aliens         | 1986 | Sigourney Weaver | Ellen Ripley       | 1
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Diane Keaton     | Annie Hall         | 2
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Woody Allen      | Alvy Singer        | 2
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Dennis Hopper    | Photo Journalist   | 3
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Marlon Brando    | Colonel Kurtz      | 3
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Robert Duvall    | Lt. Col. Kilgore   | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Al Pacino        | Michael Corleone   | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Diane Keaton     | Kay Adams          | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Marlon Brando    | Don Vito Corleone  | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Robert Duvall    | Tom Hagen          | 3
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tim Allen        | Buzz Lightyear     | 4
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tom Hanks        | Woody              | 4
```

Notice that `genre` column has been replaced by `genre_id` which contains an integer that references the appropriate column in the other table. This column is known as a **foreign key** in that it references a primary key in another table and _links_ to rows together.

Let's think about the relationship between genres and movies. There are several movies that belong to the same genre (e.g. both _Apocalypse Now_ and _The Godfather_ are listed as dramas) but it is not possible for a movie to have more than one genre (as we've modeled it here; in reality it is certainly possible for a movie to have many genres).

This limitation is due to the fact that each row in the movies table only has a single slot for the `genre_id`. This is referred to as a **one-to-many** relationship: a genre can have many movies, but a movie belongs to a single genre. Whichever table contains the foreign key (`genre_id` in this case) **belongs to** the other table and the other table **has many** of the former.

How do we use SQL to create this database design? We can create the movies and genres tables as outlines below. Notice this foreign key column is on the movies tables and the genres table simply has a primary key, because it can have many movies.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE genres(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE movies(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  year INT,
  actor VARCHAR(255),
  character VARCHAR(255),
  genre_id INT REFERENCES genres(id)
);
```

The references keyword looks for the table and column for the foreign key to complete the relationship.

One-to-many relationships are very common when modeling data: e.g. a blog has many articles but an article belongs to a single blog, a product has many reviews but a review belongs to a single product, an artist has many songs but a song belongs to a single artist. Sometimes it is questionable whether the one-to-many relationship will always hold (e.g. a song may belong to more than one artist) but this is a design decision we have to make when building our database. Many-to-many relationships (which we'll cover shortly) are more flexible at modeling data, but sometimes it is better to be more restrictive to keep our data simpler.

### Many-to-Many Relationships

Now that we've taken care of genres, let's continue normalizing our movies table:

```no-highlight
title          | year | actor            | character          | genre_id
---------------+------+------------------+--------------------+-----------
Aliens         | 1986 | Sigourney Weaver | Ellen Ripley       | 1
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Diane Keaton     | Annie Hall         | 2
Annie Hall     | 1977 | Woody Allen      | Alvy Singer        | 2
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Dennis Hopper    | Photo Journalist   | 3
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Marlon Brando    | Colonel Kurtz      | 3
Apocalypse Now | 1979 | Robert Duvall    | Lt. Col. Kilgore   | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Al Pacino        | Michael Corleone   | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Diane Keaton     | Kay Adams          | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Marlon Brando    | Don Vito Corleone  | 3
The Godfather  | 1972 | Robert Duvall    | Tom Hagen          | 3
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tim Allen        | Buzz Lightyear     | 4
Toy Story 2    | 1999 | Tom Hanks        | Woody              | 4
```

It's clear that we're duplicating the movie information as we see the same title and year combination appear multiple times. We also have duplicate actor information: Diane Keaton, Marlon Brandon, and Robert Duvall all appear in more than one row. The catch here is that they portray different characters in each movie.

Let's start by separating movies and actors. It seems straightforward that movies and actors are two separate entities, but we need to figure out how to split up the columns in our existing table. Movies will most likely contain the title, year, and genre:

```no-highlight
id | title          | year | genre_id
---+----------------+------+-----------
1  | Aliens         | 1986 | 1
2  | Annie Hall     | 1977 | 2
3  | Apocalypse Now | 1979 | 3
4  | The Godfather  | 1972 | 3
5  | Toy Story 2    | 1999 | 4
```

If we use the remainder for the actors table we end up with:

```no-highlight
id | actor            | character
---+------------------+-------------------
1  | Al Pacino        | Michael Corleone
2  | Dennis Hopper    | Photo Journalist
3  | Diane Keaton     | Annie Hall
4  | Diane Keaton     | Kay Adams
5  | Marlon Brando    | Colonel Kurtz
6  | Marlon Brando    | Don Vito Corleone
7  | Robert Duvall    | Lt. Col. Kilgore
8  | Robert Duvall    | Tom Hagen
9  | Sigourney Weaver | Ellen Ripley
10 | Tim Allen        | Buzz Lightyear
11 | Tom Hanks        | Woody
12 | Woody Allen      | Alvy Singer
```

This is a bit of a problem. We have an actors table where we would expect each row to represent an individual actor but we can still see some duplication. Several actors appear more than once if they were in more than one movie. We could delete those extra rows, but we lose information about the character they portrayed. If we keep the extra rows, we no longer have a single, unambiguous record for each actor (is Diane Keaton actor ID 3 or 4)?

What we have here is a different type of relationship between movies and actors. A movie can have many actors, but an actor can also star in many movies. This can be modeled using a **many-to-many** relationship. Unfortunately, we can't get away with just including foreign keys on the actors or movies table.

On both sides of the many-to-many relationship we usually have entities that can exist independently. We might have a movie with no actors or an actor that hasn't starred in any movies (if you would still call them an actor). But we also can't restrict a movie to having one actor or an actor to starring in one movie, so adding an `actor_id` or `movie_id` column to either table won't work (since it can only reference a single row).

The solution is to include a third table that links records from both tables together. This is known as a **join table** and is necessary to model a many-to-many relationship. At a minimum, a join table needs to include a foreign key of both tables it is trying to join. Let's see what our modified movies and actors table look like with our join table:

```no-highlight
     movies
---+----------------+------+-----------
id | title          | year | genre_id
---+----------------+------+-----------
1  | Aliens         | 1986 | 1
2  | Annie Hall     | 1977 | 2
3  | Apocalypse Now | 1979 | 3
4  | The Godfather  | 1972 | 3
5  | Toy Story 2    | 1999 | 4

     actors
---+-----------------
id | actor
---+-----------------
1  | Al Pacino
2  | Dennis Hopper
3  | Diane Keaton
4  | Marlon Brando
5  | Robert Duvall
6  | Sigourney Weaver
7  | Tim Allen
8  | Tom Hanks
9  | Woody Allen

     join_table
---------+----------
movie_id | actor_id
---------+----------
 1       | 6
 2       | 3
 2       | 9
 3       | 2
 3       | 4
 3       | 5
 4       | 1
 4       | 3
 4       | 4
 4       | 5
 5       | 7
 5       | 8
```

The join table exists to link two tables together. Each row represents the coupling between an actor and movie, i.e. a movie that the actor starred in. To model this in our schema we would use the same references key word for both columns.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE join_table(
  movie_id INT REFERENCES movies(id),
  actor_id INT REFERENCES actors(id)
);
```

You might notice we lost a bit of information in the translation though. Since our actors table only contains one row per actor we had to drop the name of the character they portrayed. This information doesn't really belong on the actors table since it is dependent on the movie, nor does it really belong on the movies table since it is dependent on the actor. The best location would be the join table since it is the coupling of the two tables. In fact, our join table can be thought of as the list of cast members:

```no-highlight
    cast_members
---------+----------+--------------
movie_id | actor_id | character
---------+----------+--------------
 1       | 6        | Ellen Ripley
 2       | 3        | Annie Hall
 2       | 9        | Alvy Singer
 3       | 2        | Photo Journalist
 3       | 4        | Colonel Kurtz
 3       | 5        | Lt. Col. Kilgore
 4       | 1        | Michael Corleone
 4       | 3        | Kay Adams
 4       | 4        | Don Vito Corleone
 4       | 5        | Tom Hagen
 5       | 7        | Buzz Lightyear
 5       | 8        | Woody
```

Sometimes join tables exist to link two tables together and nothing more, but in other cases they are an entity by themselves. Here we're using the join table to attach more information about the coupling of an actor to a movie, specifically what role they played.

### In Summary

Creating relationships among our tables allows us to simplify or **normalize** our data. Two types of relation ships we can create are a **one-to-many** or a **many-to-many**. These relationships help us associate our data and then query it in more efficient ways.
