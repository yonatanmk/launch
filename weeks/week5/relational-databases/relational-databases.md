### Introduction

In this video lesson, we learn about relational databases, using Postgres. We take a data model for a neighborhood and convert it to SQL. We then use SQL JOIN statements to see how the associations bring the data to life.


### Learning Goals

* Understand how to make SQL out of a data model
* Create a database and then run the SQL to create the tables
* Write queries that illuminate the associations among our tables
